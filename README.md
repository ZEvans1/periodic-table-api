# _Periodic Table_

#### _A web application for Java week 4 @ Epicodus, Jan. 26, 2018_

#### By _**Zach Evans**_

## Description

_This is code for the beginning of an API for the periodic table of elements. Using REST, the following actions are currently possible:_

* _Create groups for the table (columns)_
* _Create periods for the table (rows)_
* _Create elements_
* _View groups, periods, or elements
* _Assign elements to groups

_Next steps are:_

* _Assign elements to periods_
* _Allow sorting of elements (atomic number, atomic mass, alphabetical, etc)_

_This was designed so that additional properties like electron configuration or isotopes could be easily added to the objects and database later on._
